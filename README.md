# cs50_backups

A collection of files from CS50 problem sets

## Recover

- A simple program used to recover files with a known signature.
- For the purpose of this exercise, blocks size can be assumed as
  512 bytes and slack space (i.e. the remaining bytes after the
  end of each 'recovered file' until the end of the block ) can be
  ignored.
